            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>Jamiroquai is a multi-genre, mainly acid jazz, band that was formed in London, England. They are fronted by Jay Kay, and were very influential in the UK's acid jazz scene in the 90's.
            As time went on, more genres had been incorporated into their discography, such as rock, disco, electronic, and latin music. The band would also lyrically address commentary on environmental and social justice issues.
            The band, Jamiroquai, would be formed by front man Jason "Jay Kay" Cheetham, as well as the other original members being, co-founder and keyboardist Toby Smith 
            Nick Van Gelder on drums, Derrick McKenzie and Wallis Buchanan on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Didgeridoo">didgeridoo</a>; which is a tribal wind instrument made by the aboriginal
            people from Australia.
            </p>
            <p>
            They had made their debut under Acid Jazz Records in 1992 with their single <i>When You Gonna Learn?</i> 
            However, they got signed under Sony Records, which had finally gave them some mainstream success, and released multiple albums that had topped UK Charts, 
            such as <i>Emergency on Planet Earth</i>(1993), <i>Synkronized</i>(1999), and <i>A Funk Odyssey</i>(2001).
            </p>
            <p>
                Their concerts would also not be any less interesting, as the stage would be '70s inspired in many ways, such as the lighting, pyrotechnics, and other acid jazz influences. Jay Kay would also sport head gear that, some he designed himself, are futuristic-looking and sci-fi-esque. 
                Jamiroquai's concerts would also "have a rapport with the audience" and "a disarming sense of humor"(Robert Hilburn). 
            </p>
            <p>
                Some of their music is still played and loved by the millions today, as their number 1 hit single, "Virtual Insanity", is still played and listened to everyday.

            <h3>1986-1991</h3>
            <p>Before forming Jamiroquai, Jay would be a homeless young adult, getting by working sequential jobs, living paycheck-to-paycheck and getting by. During this time, he would be sending multiple
            songs to different record companies, including a hip-hop single distributed under the label, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/StreetSounds">StreetSounds</a>.
            Jay would be influenced by Native American and First-Worlder people and their philosophies, that would compell him to make the single, "When You Gonna Learn". 
            This would not go out without a hitch, as Jay had to fight with his producer over the creation of this record to keep the lyrics from his song in, as opposed to take at least half of it out to make his song
            fit the status quo with what was trending at the time.  
            </p>
            <p> After getting the track restored to Jay's own version, he realized what he needed to do was to make his own band with their own proper live sound. As it were prophecy, he came up with the name "Jamiroquai",
            which was the portmanteau, or a combination, of the words "jam" and the Native American confederacy, the Iroquois. In 1991, he had been signed to Acid Jazz Records after sending in a cover of a song made by the "Brand New Heavies". 
            Jay's manager at the time would go on to scout other talents, such as Toby Smith, and the other original members of the band. In 1992, Jamiroquai would get started by performing in the British Club Scene as they released their hit single, "When You Gonna Learn". 
            </p>
            <p>After releasing their single, the song would get popular outside the UK's Top 50 on its initial release. After its success, not only did they get a new bassist, Stuart Zender, but they got signed a one-million dollar, eight-album record deal 
            with Sony Soho. Even though the proceeds would mostly go to Jay, he would share his wealth and pay his band memebers' contributions as musicians. For their U.S. based releases, it would be released under the Work Group. 
            The band would release their debut album <i>Emergency on Planet Earth</i>, which would top at No. 1 of U.K. charts with critical acclaim, as Kevin L. Carter from <i>The Philadelphia Inquirer</i>, would put it, " [The album] is full of upbeat, multi-hued pop tunes based heavily in acid jazz,
            '70s fusion, funk, soul, raggae, and world music". With this coverage, Jamiroquai would continue to express themselves, and experiment with sounds of acid-jazz and other sounds.

        <article class = "item-2">
        <h3>1994-2000</h3>
        <p>As the band's original drummer, Nick van Gelder, failed to return from his vacation, Derrick McKenzie would instantly replace him in one audition, and would get started on their work writing and producing their next album.
            In 1994, the album, <i>Return of the Space Cowboy</i>, had released and was in the top ten at number 2 on the U.K. charts. During its recording, Jay would be stuck in creative block, which would worsen by his increased drug use at the time; however, 
            this would also have a hand in the album's complex songwriting. Regardless, this song would have positive acclaim, and it would said that "it captured the first phase of Jamiroquai's beginning at its best.", as stated by Daryl Easlea of BBC Music.
            Josef Woodard from <i>Entertainment Weekly</i> would also praise the album for using human sounds instead of using automated samplers.
        </p> 

        <p>
            <i>Travelling Without Moving</i>, released in 1996, has been one of, if not, their most critically acclaimed album to date - selling over 8 million copies worldwide. The album made its way onto the <i>Billboard 200</i> at number 24, and number 2 on U.K. charts. 
             This album had also gotten on to getting listed for a Guiness World Record for the best-selling funk album since 2001[Wikipedia]. The album's most popular song, "Virtual Insanity", which it preaches of the dangers of how fast technology is evolving,
             had gone on to grow in popularity after the creation of its music video. It would frequently be broadcasted on Music Television(MTV), and is one of the most popular music videos ever on YouTube sitting at 258 Million Views. As well as having a Guiness Award, Jamiroquai would also go onto win Video of the Year, 
             Best Visual Effects, being a Breakthrough video, and Best Cinematography at the 1997 MTV awards.Jay's intention in creating this album, was to have a more accessible sound where it would contain symphonic and jungle elements. Praised as an improvement compared to previous projects made by the band, according to Ted Kessler of <i>New Musical Express</i>(NME). 
        </p>

        <p>
            In 1998, before the release of their next album, Jamiroquai would write and produce the song "Deeper Underground", which had been released as a single and had gotten featured as part of the 1998 <i>Godzilla</i> film. Which would also go onto to be nominated for a 1998 BRIT Award as well as 
            and reach number 1 on the U.K. singles chart. The song would also go onto be a bonus track on their later album, <i>Synkronized</i>. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Meanwhile the band was preparing the record and produce their next album, Stuart Zender had left Jamiroquai due to internal conflicts with Jay over creative differences. In order to avoid any lawsuits or legal issues, during production, any contributions made by Zender would be scrapped while recruiting Nick Fyffe as their newest band member at this time.
            As a result, the 1999 record, <i>Synkronized</i>, would be manifested of a collective combination of both "tighter, and more angry" songs. The premise of the album would also change from preaching about social issues and "long" tunes. It also includes songs with a unique instrumentation such as in "Canned Heat", where it used "sveltic Chic Organisation Strings" 
            and a "stomping four-on-the-floor-rhythm". Other songs on the album would have a slower tempo in order to ease the pressure for Jay's more romantic musings. After being released, the album would go onto reach number 28 on the <i>Billboard 200</i>, as well as reach number 1 on the U.K. best albums chart at the time. The song "Canned Heart" would also be featured in the 2004 film
            <i>Napoleon Dynamite</i>, in its most climactic dance scene in an auditorium before a proper release.

            <h3>2001-2011</h3>
        <p>
            Around this time, Jamiroquai would explore Latin music influences and incorporate it into their discography. In 2001, at the same time they introduced their new guitarist, Rob Harris, 
            they would release their fifth album, <i>A Funk Odyssey</i>. Which not only had included Latin Music, but also included their signature "robo-funk" style. As well as their other albums, it would also be praised for being different, but still keep the same quality - in the words of Jim Abbot of <i>Orlando Sentinel</i>, 
            "[Rob Harris' guitar playing] melts seductively into a mix that occasionally incorporates lavish orchestration". The album would top U.K. charts upon release; however, the album would only reach Number 44 on the U.S. <i>Billboard 200</i> chart. Not only would it be their fifth album, but it would be the last album done with their keyboardist, Toby Smith,
            whom left the next year, since he wanted to spend more time with his own family. When Jay was writing the songs for the album, he would only write "Little L" in only 25 minutes time, and he would also write an emotional track, "Picture of My Life", where he would cry through the making of the song, and look at personal issues and understand their lingering effects. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Releasing in 2005, follows their sixth studio album, <i>Dynamite</i>, which would be number 3 in the U.K. 
            It was said by Rashod D. Ollison of <i>The Baltimore Sun</i> that the album "boasts a harder, digital edge with heavier beats and manipulated guitar lines with odd textures", and that is less organic than the band's previous efforts. Its tracks, such as "Feel Just Like it Should" and "Love Blind", had the attributes of having a "fatter, dirtier sound than usual".
            "Feels Like it Should" would be album's first single as it would hit number 8 upon its inception on U.K. charts; conversely, the same song would hit number 1 on the U.S. <i>Billboard</i> dance chart. The single would also go gold in Japan after selling over 100,000 copies. Their second most popular single, "Seven Days in Sunny June", would peak at number 14 in the U.K. and also be featured in the film, <i>The Devil Wears Prada</i>. 
            The third most popular single off the album would be "[Don't] Give Hate a Chance", where it would be a politcally-charged song with a message of not spreading hate and understanding the root of hatred as a whole. The music video would feature a CGI cartoon character wearing a comically large buffalo hat, sunglasses, and a blue tracksuit. It would also peak in the top 20 on the U.K. <i>Smash Hits</i> and <i>Hit40UK</i> charts.
            <i>Dynamite</i> would be recorded in multiple locations, including at Jay's Chillington Studios; however, the following year the contract between Sony and Jamiroquai would cease. Which would ultimately manifest a collection of the band's biggest hits in a compilation album, <i>High Times: Singles 1992-2006</i>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Fun Fact: Jamiroquai also holds the Guiness World Record for the world's fastest concert while performing at the Gig in the Sky, where a concert held on a Boeing 757 in association with Sony Ericsson, as they travelled at a speed up to 1,017 killometers per hour, or 632 mph. 
        </p> 
        
        <p>
            Four years later, Jamiroquai would release a new album under a new label, Mercury Records, called <i>Rock Dust Light Star</i>. It had charted at number 7 in the U.K., Jay would go onto state that this album is a "real band record" that "really captures the flow and feel of our live performances". The album entirely came out to be a massive collaboration between band members, as they all had contributed in the songwriting. Recorded in Jay's home in Buckinghamshire, U.K.
            - The band would be inspired by early rock legends, such as Rod Stewart, Roxy Music, and the Rolling Stones. In order to promote the album's release, Jamiroquai would tour in the countries of Columbia and Brazil before considering a world tour the following year; the album would ultimately be praised as a renaissance of their original funk-style from years ago. <i>The Daily Telegraph</i> reviewed the album as, "blistering, poetic, meaty, reflective, and inspiring". 
            The album peaked at number 7 on the U.K. Album Chart, and sold over 34,378 copies, and increased to 210,000 copies sold at the end of the year where the album would go gold in the U.K. after passing the 100,000 copies sold mark.

            <h3>2017-Beyond</h3>

            <p>After the release of <i>Rock Dust Light Star</i>, Jamiroquai would go quiet after a few years until they would release their eight, and most recent album, <i>Automation</i>, released in March of 2017, through Virgin EMI. The album would peak at number 4 in the U.K., and it would be produced soley by Jay and new keyboardist, Matt Johnson. The album's premise was to describe the rise of Artificial Intelligence and how humans are forgetting the smaller, simpler things in life 
            as well as forming relationships or socializing with other human beings. The album would ultimately recieve an overall positive review with a 71% rating on Metacritic. The album recieved praise for keeping true to the band's core as it "has that sense of love and good vibes that drive [Automation]"(Matt Collar, AllMusic). Despite not being released as a single, one of its songs, "Shake it On", peaked French Charts at number 154. Jamiroquai would do a tour for the album around this time, 
            Starting in Feburary-March, they would tour the U.K., Denmark, and France. May they would tour in Tokyo, Japan and they would go back to the U.K. for their last tour in London in August. Unfortunate news would come out the following month that one of the founding members, and original keyboardist, Toby Smith, had died in September 2017 of losing his battle to cancer. Stuart Zender and Jay Kay would go onto pay tribute to the loss of their member, "I love him, my big brother crossed over to the other side last night",
            Zender would state in an instagram post. 
            </p>

            <p>
            Today, the band consists of frontman Jay Kay, Rob Harris, McKenzie, Johnson, Paul Turner on bass guitar, Sola Akingbola on percussion, Nate Williams on guitar and keyboard, and Howard Whiddett with Ableton Live. After releasing the 2021 single, "Everybody's Going to the Moon", Jamiroquai gave a teaser on the back of the notes that a new album will be coming out soon.

            <h2>Why Jamiroquai & Their Legacy is Important</h2>
            <p>
            Around the 1990s, disco and funk were dying and people refused to look at seriously. Jamiroquai would come onto the scene around this time and contribute to the London-based funk and acid-jazz movement. The band would fight to be taken seriously by the public and by the industry, not only would they fight to be recognized, but they would also have to deal with media snobbery and criticism towards their outgoing music style. Despite this, the band had always stayed relevant and remain visible, as only a few acid-jazz based artists and groups
            would reach their level of popularity. Not only did they make they fight for themselves, but they would also fight through song for social justice, animal rights, conservation, and Native American rights. Such as "Too Young to Die" from their first album, <i>Emergency on Planet Earth</i>, where they would protest war and everything would be "too young" to die, not just people, but the trees, animals, and just the earth are not and will never be ready for death. As well as their first single, "When You Gonna Learn", also protest and warn about the environmental
            impact that mankind has done to the earth so far, and the future. Jamiroquai would also support charity, Greenpeace, which is a Canadian company that preserves the Earth and its monuments; they would also support other efforts for conservation, and animal rights. Jamiroquai's music would also stand the test of time, inspiring other artists of our current generation, such as Calvin Harris, Chance the Rapper, and Tyler, the Creator, their music would bring attention to the lesser-known instrument, the didgeridoo. Even though they were not very popular in the United States,
            in their native country, the United Kingdom, they would always be in the same league as Oasis and the Spice Girls. Their album, <i>Travelling Without Moving</i>, would be universally loved by both countries and the single, "Virtual Insanity", would mark the climax that acid-jazz based artists in the '90s were trying to accomplish. Jay's story should also be respected as he came from almost nothing, once a factory worker now superstar, he made something of himself while gaining support from his producers and band members. Him and his bandmates have contributed much to music
            and to environmental awareness, they had also recieved praise and a stamp of approval from people like Quincy Jones and Maurice White from Earth, Wind and Fire. Despite this, the band would release albums less and less frequently, Jay would say: "I will only put out an album now when I'm inspired to do so", to ensure the best quality of music for their fans. As of 2017, Jamiroquai had sold over 26 Million Albums worldwide and are still making music to this day.
